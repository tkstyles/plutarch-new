    <h1>Pericles</h1>
    
    <p class="text">
Plutarch portrays Pericles as one of Athens’ greatest statesmen, guiding the city during its Golden Age. Born into a wealthy and noble family, he was the son of Xanthippus, a hero of the Persian Wars, and Agariste, from the influential Alcmaeonid clan. Gifted with intelligence and a commanding presence, Pericles was educated by philosophers like Anaxagoras, who influenced his calm, rational approach to leadership.

Pericles rose to prominence in a democratic Athens, skillfully using his eloquence and political judgment to lead without resorting to flattery. Plutarch notes that his speeches carried a unique “music” and gravity that stirred both respect and persuasion. Under his guidance, Athens became the cultural and political center of Greece. He oversaw monumental building projects—most famously the Parthenon—and fostered the flourishing of art, drama, and philosophy.

Though accused by rivals of extravagance and of consolidating too much power, Pericles remained incorruptible in public life. His policies strengthened Athens’ naval empire and expanded its democratic institutions. Plutarch admires his dignity, restraint, and dedication to the city’s greatness, even during the hardships of the Peloponnesian War and the plague that claimed his life in 429 BCE.

To Plutarch, Pericles was the model of a leader who combined intellectual depth, moral character, and political skill to elevate his city to unparalleled heights.
